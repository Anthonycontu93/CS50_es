            <h2 title="title">Anthony's journey</h2>
            <p title="description">I was born in 1993, on November 6th to be exact. In a small town called Castelletto Sopra Ticino. A small country, too small for my dreams. You know, the true beauty of the village and I believe above all of the village in Italy, is life; yes, because life here goes slower, very slowly, people all know each other, one with the other, there are no secrets and no privacy; if someone does something everyone knows, indeed perhaps they know it even before you have done it. </p>

             <h5>Flying out</h5>
                <p>My journey in search of me started in 2013, I had never taken a plane, and I did not know a word of English or other languages. I was on an adventure. So, after a roll of the dice, fate chose the day for us to leave; I forgot, there were two of us, my cousin and I, even looking for himself, or looking for whatever we were looking for. Pack your bags, gentlemen.</p>

            <h5>London, here I am!</h5>
              <p> Arrived, and like the many stories heard, by others who had already been there, the city welcomed us with a beautiful rain, gray and cloudy sky; the mood was not at its best, but we did not know that from that day on life would change, for the better.  The first days all was very complicated, the language, the money, the hostels, the job search, the loneliness, ah yes, my adventure companion left after almost a month, and I stayed there. The obstinacy to find a path of my own, different, out of the predetermined route, it was really a lot, it is so, I didn’t give up. </p>
              <p>  The obstinacy to find a path of my own, different, out of the predetermined route, it was really a lot, it is so, I didn’t give up. I do not know how, why or for some strange reason from them shortly I would have lived the most beautiful moments of my life, until now at least.</p>

                        <p> After several years working in the restaurant, I and two other friends tried to open a small pizzeria in Ibiza. Unfortunately, one of us decided to abandon the ship and so we had to close. It did not go very well as first experience, indeed I would say disastrous, but still we must treasure it. If you click the button you will visit our menu, it was really delicious, even the pizza excellent. <a class="btn btn-warning" href="https://leggimenu.it/menu/los3amigos">Menù</a></p>
