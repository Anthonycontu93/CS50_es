Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With 10 simulations you obtain a wrong prediction

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: With 100 prediction you could actually obtain a good result.
